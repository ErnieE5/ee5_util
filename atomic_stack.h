// atomic_stack
//
//  This is a simple template that manages a lock free stack based on more portable C++ 11 atomic 
//  operations library. Use this template when the data structure contains a member value that
//  allows for storage of a pointer to the next item down.
//
//  For a larger number of programming strategies, using a data member to maintain linked lists
//  is not always the "best practice" for more "modern" styles of programming. This quite simple
//  template is a way to help add some type safety to store homogeneous sets of data. (In this 
//  case it mostly means that the linked list pointers are in a uniform location / offset within
//  the structure.) 
//
//  There are a gazillion more comments in this header than the code that is actually generated.
//  In optimized builds the vast majority of this falls away.
//
//  The only current requirement is that the type T has a public ~data~ member named 'next.'
//
//  TODO: (FUTURE:?)
//      Currently Clang is crashing if including self-referential declarations ~and~
//      the type T has an anonymous union ~and~ the -g option is used during the build!
//
//      The changes are simple. Uncomment the template declaration below, and add a couple of
//      asterisks in the item->*next calls.
//                             ^
