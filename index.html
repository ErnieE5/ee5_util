<p>C++ Utilities</p>

<p>During my career I have worked on many systems that share the fundamental basis of the work that this code represents. All  all of that code is proprietary in nature and was done as work for hire. (After all, I like to eat and have a home, you know, basics.) The last major system I worked on started prior to C++ 11 being finalized and was based on Microsoft cl 16. <em>Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 16.00.40219.01 for x64</em> The support for TR1 was decent, but lacked the most important feature I was looking forward to: Variadic templates. It wasn't the best idea for the project to base that work on something that was still in flux, so those ideas were expressed as best as possible. I've had the opportunity to work on the ideas within the framework of the "more modern design" of C++ 11 and this represents the principles of that work.</p>

<p>The basic idea is an attempt to unify all the "goodness" of the systems I have worked on in the past, into something that I can publicly display (warts included at this point). I have borrowed ideas from many projects and worked them into this design. If I have the time and resources I'd like to make this more general purpose, but I doubt that is ultimately likely. The programming model isn't far from what a developer used to using a "managed" platform might expect and has a few "functional" ideas tossed in.</p>

<p><strong>This is a work in progress at the moment.</strong> It works (in principle) but needs (a lot of) further development to make it fully functional. (Many of the files aren't properly staged and code is still being placed where expedient.) A more mature project would have most of this under control, but the foundational items are being put together. </p>
