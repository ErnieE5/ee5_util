// spinning locks
//
//  Using a spin lock in parallel code ~can~ be more efficient over a relatively long time. Much
//  of any gain is largely dependent on the load factor. If your program is well split up and the
//  scheduled operations are very short duration, the "win" ~can~ be as much as 4-5%. When I say
//  ~can~ it is just that. The win is over the VERY long run and is an average. Lots of things get
//  in the way if you are running on a preemptively scheduled OS. The gain over a mutex is largely
//  due to not incurring a call into the kernel to potentially park the thread. Adding "tons" of
//  threads for "complex computations" gets you no ware, slowly. For this algorithm and test,
//  "hyper threading" comes into play. For other tasks, this might not be as possible.
//
//  The benefit of a spin lock is considerably less when a "larger" amount of work per scheduled
//  work item is done. Anytime a work thread is preempted and the OS grabs the quantum during a
//  lock, the spike in time obliterates any benefit. (Keep your locks short!)
//
//  Another thing to keep in mind is locality of various locks. If you place two spin locks
//  on the same cache line, then those locks will have contention as well. i.e.:
//
//  Don't ~EVER~ put multiple "highly contentious" memory locking primitives together like this:
//
//      spin_mutex x;
//      spin_mutex y;
//      std::atomic<size_t> z;
//
//  The effect is that any will stall the other's access to the underlying control
//  variable. If the locks are exceptionally well used in the program (say a count of times
//  a particular branch is taken) the impact ~can~ be as much as 20% slower. Even if x and y
//  are "rarely" contentious, if ++z is frequently called, x & y will both stall briefly
//  during the increment. (This matters only for "exceptionally hot" memory locations.) The
//  CPU "stall" is due to the lock needing to make it all the way down to main memory. Different
//  memory speeds, cache architectures, bus speeds, cache levels, etc will contribute.
//
//  The std::mutex is the lowest common denominator and the C++11 primitives help make the best
//  of this tricky optimization.
//
//  In a nearly perfect asynchronous program, User code should ~never~ "park" a thread in a
//  thread pool.
//
// Note on VM's:
//
//  On virtual hardware (pretty much every cloud system in existence today), a spin lock can
//  end up being MORE costly than a typical mutex (or CriticalSection). Choose wisely and
//  always TEST with time on target before making a choice.
//
//  The statement that a spin lock is ALWAYS faster than a mutex is simply NOT TRUE when ALL
//  dependent factors are accounted for.
//
//  TODO: Move the following discussion ~and~ tests into a separate test file.
//
//  A few run tests with the "work" being a marginally expensive factorial calculation and the
//  difference in performance based on each work_items load. As expected, the gain is considerably
//  smaller the larger the work load. The actual work item ends up being mostly inline and the
//  code will largely stay in the local CPU cache. (Remember this test is mostly the locking
//  primitive and REAL code MUST account for larger amounts of memory movement between main memory
//  and the work_thread AND code movement in and out as well.)

//  spin_reader_writer_lock<>
//
// Notes:
//
//  This idea is kinda based on how the SRWLock from MSFT works, but adapted to use the C++
//  support for threading. (aka a shared_mutex)
//
//  The idea of "max exclusive" writers is kind-of "stupid" BUT if you have a system that
//  might have a large number of writers wanting exclusive access, you need to trap all
//  but the first one. Most of my designs typically have only a single writer, but in order
//  to keep this generally more useful the base class uses a traits system to allow for
//  the behavior to be modified. The default implementation allows for 65k (I told you,
//  absurd) writers to hit the spin at the same time. My current hardware can only encounter
//  a ~theoretical~ 8 way race and predictions are reasonable that we won't see 64bit
//  CPU's with 65k cores in my life time. (It WOULD however, be cool to see this!)
//
//  Basically, the maximum number of "spinners" is a function of the number of CPU's/cores
//  that have concurrent access to the memory bus. Each one of the memory access methods
//  atomically access the underlying memory during a single instruction. The OS can't
//  switch a thread context outside of a single instruction, therefore even if you have
//  thousands of writer threads, the total number can ONLY get that high IF (this is absurdly
//  unlikely, but not impossible) the OS thread quantum was set to the cycle / instruction level.
//  (A single chip with 64GB of "cache / main memory" and 8 cores might pull this off. I am
//  not going to hold my breath!)
//
//  One of the uses this class is good for is tracking "pending work" and blocking "new"
//  work. for those uses an "absurd" number of concurrent readers needs to be supported.
//  In this case the default on a 64bit system is a little over 1 billion "concurrent" readers.
//
//  Depending on usage, I have seen dozens of readers hold a lock for "a while." In (good)
//  concurrent design, you really shouldn't hold a lock very long. (For the case of the read
//  "locks" being a "trap" for pending work in a pool it's probably OK as the only time an
//  exclusive lock is taken is during a termination phase.)
